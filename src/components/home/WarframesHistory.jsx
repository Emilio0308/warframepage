            WARFRAMES
          </h2>
          <p>
            They were called Tenno. Sword and firearm warriors: masters of the
            Warframe armor. Survivors of the Ancient War, adrift among the
            ruins. Now they are needed once again.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Grineer, with their vast armies, are spreading throughout the
            Origin System. A call echoes through the stars, summoning the Tenno
            to an ancient place. Summoning you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let Lotus guide you. She rescued you from your cryostasis chamber
            and gave you the opportunity to survive. The Grineer will find you;
            you must be prepared. Lotus will teach you how to wield the
            Warframes and the secrets to unlock their powers.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-center font-semibold tracking-widest text-xl">
            COME ON, TENNO, YOU MUST JOIN THE WAR.
